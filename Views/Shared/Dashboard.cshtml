    We at the Bryant Corner Cafe love being your community restaurant. There are uncertain and hard times we are all
    facing and our hearts go out to everyone effected by this. We are committed to doing our best to serve the community
    that we consider family and friends by offering coffee, pastries, and take-out in accordance with the guidelines and
    standards under Washington State protocol.

    We have always been very consciously aware of food safety and cleaning standards and have a rating of excellent by
    the Department of Health, which we take pride in. We have enhanced our cleaning and safe food handling and are
    concentrating on high-touch areas, including public counters, door handles, and restrooms.

    With your support, understanding, and trust, we will be able to keep the doors open. We feel lucky to have such
    loyal people in our lives and thank you in advance for your continued support. We are all in this together.

    Thank you and good health.

    - Sara and the entire staff here at Bryant Corner Cafe
